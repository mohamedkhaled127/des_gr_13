Abstract

   The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force
   attacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed
   adversary.  As a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications
   continue to rely on DES for security, and designers and implementers
   continue to support it in new applications.  While this is not always
   inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security
   implications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all
   the information they need to make judicious decisions regarding its
   use.
